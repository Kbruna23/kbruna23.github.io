			<h1> Hello explorer!</h1>
			<p>My name is Karīna and i have traveled since I was four-years-old. I have been to three Erasmus programs and traveled with my family. In this website i would like to share my experience with you and share advice that I think would be interesting and useful to know. I hope this website will inspire you to plan a vacation elsewhere anytime soon. </p>

					<h1> Important!</h1>
					<p>Check your <em>passport or ID card</em> when you leave the house. Also check the expiering date of your documents. Check twice the information before buying the tickets. Don`t forget your <em>phone charger</em> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h1> Suitcase</h1>
					<p>Check the weather news in your destination before leaving and pack clothes that can be used in more than one outfit. Accesories for me is a must, so I advice you, take some funky sunglasses, it will give you core memories :) I like to take a book with me and read sometimes. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h1> Search for cheap tickets</h1>
					<p>Searching for cheaper tickets can be difficult depending of the destination, but better cheaper tickets and R&B, so you have more money to spend in exploring culture and food.</p>
